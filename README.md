# Java-Projects
This Java Program is designed to take a word and check whether or not it is a Palindrome word(A word that would look the same spelled backwards) and if it is atleast 3 letters long. To test it, type a word into the parameter on line 28:         
System.out.println(isPalindrome("TYPE WORD HERE"));
click run.

If it is a Palindrome word the console should say "<word> is a palindrome word", if not it should say "<word> is not a palindrome word", and if it's less than 3 letters it should say "Please enter a word with 3 letters or more"

Test cases have been uploaded.
